### installation (chrome / chromium)
I included a simple ``manifest.json`` so you can import it as a chrome extension.  
just clone this repo and load unpacked extension. (you have to enable developer mode)    
![unpacked](screenshots/unpacked.png)  
you can also install this in firefox or any browser, just set the ``index.html`` to your new tab page / create an addon which replaces the new tab page with this ``index.html``

### custom images
if you want a custom image, put it in the ``img`` folder.
the image should be either a standard portrait image (good for left image) or a wide slice/landscape image (good for top image).   

After you put it in the img folder you can just change the image path in settings to the filename (don't add img/)
